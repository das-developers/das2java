<p>The fileSystem package introduces a filesystem abstraction that allows various
types of file systems to be accessed in a convenient and uniform way.  (A file 
system is a heirarchical set of files.)  This allows clients to "mount" an 
ftp site and access the files easily and in the same way a local file system 
would be.
</p>
<p>FileStorageModel is a class that models how filenames are constructed within
a filesystem from times when files are used to implement a database.
</p>
<p>FileSystem defines the interface clients see.  Implementations of this include
    HTTPFileSystem, FTPFileSystem, and LocalFileSystem.  FileObjects provide access
to Files within the FileSystem, and metadata about the file.  </p>
<p>HtmlUtil provides generally 
useful methods, such as scraping all the URL references from a stream.  GlobUtil
converts os globs like *.dat to regular expressions.  
    </p>
    <p>ZipFileSystem allows a Zip file to be mounted just like any other filesystem.
        Note it has been implemented in Autoplot's DataSource package and was finally
        moved to here.  The DataSource package may have other FileSystem implementations
        which could be migrated into here.</p>
