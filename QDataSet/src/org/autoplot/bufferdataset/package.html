       <p>NIO-backed dataset implementation of QDataSet allows memory 
       outside of the JVM to be used to back data.  This also allows
       for files to be mapped into memory and accessed directly.
       
       For example, the CDF reader provides NIO buffers that are often backed
       by the data on the disk.  This class is used to map this data into
       a QDataSet for the rest of the system.</p>
