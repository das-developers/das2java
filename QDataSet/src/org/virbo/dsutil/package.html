       <p>Utilities that work with QDataSet.  For example, DataSetBuilder 
  is a tool for creating QDataSets by feeding in data one record at a time.
  There's QDataSetTableModel which adapts QDataSets to a model for JTable,
  and LinFit for doing linear fit.  LSpec contains routines for mapping sweeps
  of L-Shell into spectrograms.  Reduction contains routines for reducing data
  resolution.
