<p>Filters are operations applied to the data before display, and these are small
    GUIs used to control each filter step.  For example, 
the filter "|multiply(10.)" would multiply the data by 10 before display.  There are
more complex filters as well, such as "|fftPower(512)" which converts waveform data
into a spectrogram.  All filters should run fairly quickly.
</p>
<p>FilterEditorPanels are small GUIs designed to assist the scientist in creating the 
    filter specifications.  Like URIs, Autoplot depends on strings 
    to allow for future functionality and to provide portability, and then GUIs are 
    provided to construct these strings.
</p>
<p>filters.xml is used to create the chooser GUI.</p>
<p>Note when new filters are added they must be added to FiltersChainPanel as well!</p>
