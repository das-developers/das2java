/**
 * <p>QDataSets are less abstract and more flexible data model for das2.  das2's 
 * old data model was developed to deliver spectrogram time series data sets
 * where the dataset structure would change over time, and the interface is highly
 * optimized for that environment.  It's difficult to express many datasets in these
 * terms, so the simpler "quick" QDataSet was introduced.  </p>
 *
 * <p>The QDataSet can be thought of as a fast java array that has name-value metadata
 * attached to it.  These arrays of data can have arbitrary rank, although currently
 * the interface limits rank to 0,1,2,3, and 4.  (Rank N is proposed but not
 * developed.)  Each dimension's length can vary, like Java arrays, and datasets 
 * where the dimensions do not vary in length are colloquially called "Qubes."</p>
 *
 * <p>QDataSets can have other QDataSets as property values, for example the property
 * QDataSet.DEPEND_0 indicates that the values are dependent parameters of the "tags"
 * QDataSet found there.  This how how we get to the same abstraction level of 
 * the legacy Das2 dataset.  </p>
 * 
 * <p>This is inspired by the CDF data model and PaPCo's dataset model.</p>
