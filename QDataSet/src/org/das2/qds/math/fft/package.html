    Classes for performing generalized FFT transformations.  These codes are based on the
 jnt.FFT package from NIST, with the interface changed so that data copies can be avoided and
 to improve useability.  (The NIST package had implicit specifications about how to load arrays, and
 instead we use the ComplexArray interface.)  Also classes are provided for common fft operations,
 such as transforming a waveform into a spectrogram.
