      <p>QDataSets are less abstract and more flexible data model for das2.  das2's 
          current data model was developed to deliver spectrogram time series data sets
          where the dataset structure would change over time, and the interface is highly
          optimized for that environment.  It's difficult to express many datasets in these
      terms, so the simpler "quick" QDataSet was introduced.  </p>
 
      <p>The QDataSet can be thought of as a fast java array that has name-value metadata
          attached to it.  These arrays of data can have arbitrary rank, although currently
          the interface limits rank to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  (Rank N are proposed but not
          developed.)  Each dimension's length can vary, like java arrays, and datasets 
      where the dimensions do not vary in length are colloquially called "Qubes."

      </p>
 
      <p>QDataSets can have other QDataSets as property values, for example the property
          QDataSet.DEPEND_0 indicates that the values are dependend parameters of the "tags"
          QDataSet found there.  This how how we get to the same abstraction level of 
      the legacy das2 dataset. </p>
  
      <p>Mutable datasets warning: Many of the QDataSet implementations are mutable, meaning
          that values can be changed.  Generally clients can expect that QDataSets are immutable,
          so no dataset should be modified once it is accessible to the
      rest of the system.  This would require clients make defensive copies which would 
      seriously degrade performance.  Note mutable datasets (e.g. MutablePropertyDataSet) have a makeImmutable() 
      method that will throw a runtime exception when clients attempt to write to the dataset.
