        <p>Utility classes useful for the implementation of other packages, but
not necessarily part of any one package.  Also, ideally no class
in util creates a dependence on another package.  A good rule of thumb is that 
classes that are useful to more than one package that do not depend on any of 
those packages should go here.  
</p>
    <p>For example, here are some examples of classes in the package: TimeParser, 
        a generally useful class for parsing formatted time strings.  Another is Crypt, 
        a class for encrypting passwords with the crypt algorith.  Probe breaks the
        stated rules, because it utilizes the package graph to plot data.  It should find a new
        home.
