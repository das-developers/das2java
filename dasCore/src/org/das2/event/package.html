        <p>Classes for adding interactivity to the application components. 
Each DasCanvasComponent has a DasMouseInputAdapter that dispatches mouse
events.  MouseModules are plug into a DasMouseInputAdapter and receive the
mouse events and perform a function based on the input.  For example, the
CrossHairMouseModule looks up the X and Y coordinates of the pointer during a 
mouse drag and displays them in a box.  A VerticalSlicerMouseModule looks up
the Table dataSet column under the click and plots it in a popup window.
The MouseModules use DragRenderers to provide visual feedback about the pending
operation.
</p>
<p>A set of science abstraction level events is defined as well for communication
between application components.  These include, for example, TimeRangeSelectionEvent
and BoxSelectionEvent.  For example, a MouseModule might create a BoxSelectionEvent, 
then send the event off to another module that begins an analysis for the data within
the selected box.
    </p>
    <p>Each MouseModule has a DragRenderer which graphically hints at what 
action is to occur, and the state of the action.  For example, the BoxRenderer
draws a box where the MouseModule will perform some action (like summing all
the data within the box, or resetting the two axes to these new ranges).  
DragRenderers should work in the pixel space, and the MouseModule does the job
of promoting the abstraction from pixels to science data and data units.</p>
