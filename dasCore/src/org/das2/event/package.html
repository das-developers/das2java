        <p>Classes for adding interactivity to the application components. 
Each DasCanvasComponent has a DasMouseInputAdapter that dispatches mouse
events.  MouseModules are plug into a DasMouseInputAdapter and receive the
mouse events and perform a function based on the input.  For example, the
CrossHairMouseModule looks up the X and Y coodinates of the pointer during a 
mouse drag and displays them in a box.  A VerticalSlicerMouseModule looks up
the TableDataSet column under the click and plots it in a popup window.
The MouseModules use DragRenderers to provide visual feedback about the pending
operation.
</p>
<p>A set of science abstraction level events is defined as well for communication
between application components.  These include, for example, TimeRangeSelectionEvent
and BoxSelectionEvent.  For example, a MouseModule might create a BoxSelectionEvent, 
then send the event off to another module that begins an analysis for the data within
the selected box.
