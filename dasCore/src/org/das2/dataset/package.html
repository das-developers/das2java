    <p>Provides classes and interfaces for combining Datums into structured DataSets, and operators
    for working with DataSets.  The DataSet interface is the base for all DataSets, which all
    contain a set of monotonically-increasing xtags.  DataSets also contain a set of arbitary
    properties, which are String->Object mappings.  These are used to store metadata such as 
    axis labels.  DataSets can have auxiliary "planes" attached to them.  This
    mechanism was first introduced as a means to keep track of the weights
    after averaging, but we also use them for peaks-and-averages plots and
    orbits. </p>
    <p>DataSetDescriptors are used to provide access to datasets that are parametric over a long interval 
    (generally time),
    such as Voyager 1 power spectrum.  Clients request data from a DataSetDescriptor for a given time
    interval and resolution.  The base class DataSetDescriptor is abstract and implements DataSet
    caching. 
    </p>
    <p>Rebinners are DataSet operators that rebin data to a precisely-controlled set of X and Y tags.  Various
    methods for rebinning data such as bin averaging and nearest neighbor sampling are provided.</p>
    <p>Lastly, objects for caching datasets are provided.</p>
