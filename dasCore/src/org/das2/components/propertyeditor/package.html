    Classes implementing the property sheet.  The property sheet is a table of bean properties organized hierarchically.  If a bean has
another bean as a property, its properties may be accessed or hidden by folding and unfolding the property row (see treetable package).  When an editor
for the property is found, the property may be edited directly.
