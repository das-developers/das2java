    Provides GUI components for building applications.  Classes are generally
instances of Java Swing's JComponent.
    There are also many PropertyEditors which are intended to create GUIs for
Das2 objects like Datums and EnumerationEditor, and these also work with 
the PropertyEditor class, which is a generic editor for any JavaBean.
    Note there is both DataPointRecorder and DataPointRecorderNew.  DataPointRecorderNew
is actually the old one, and is just there to support old applications.
