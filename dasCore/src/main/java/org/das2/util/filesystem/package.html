<p>The fileSystem package introduces a filesystem abstraction that allows various
types of file systems to be accessed in a convenient and uniform way.  (A file 
system is a heirarchical set of files.)  This allows clients to "mount" an 
ftp site and access the files easily and in the same way a local file system 
would be.
</p>
<p>FileStorageModel is a class that models how filenames are constructed within
a filesystem from times when files are used to implement a database.
</p>
<p>FileSystem defines the interface clients see.  Implementations of this include
    HTTPFileSystem, FTPFileSystem, and LocalFileSystem.  FileObjects provide access
to Files within the FileSystem, and metadata about the file.  </p>
<p>HtmlUtil provides generally 
useful methods, such as scraping all the URL references from a stream.  GlobUtil
converts os globs like *.dat to regular expressions.
