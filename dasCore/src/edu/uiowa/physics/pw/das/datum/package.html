<p>Provides classes for encoding data as physical quanties.  The Units class
defines an enumeration of physical units such as Units.hertz and Units.microseconds.  It 
also contains a convention for identifying locations in times with units like
Units.t1970, the number of microseconds elapsed since midnight, January 1, 1970.
The Units class also contains a registry of Units and the conversions between them.
</p>
<p>A Datum is a number in the context of a Unit, for example "15 microseconds.".  
    A Datum object has methods for formatting itself as a String, representing 
    itsself as a double in the context of another Unit, and mathematical
operators that allow simple calculations to be made at the physical quantities.</p>
<p>A DatumRange is a pair of Datums that identify a range in the physical space
of a Unit.  An example of a formatted DatumRange is "January, 2005" or "0 to 50Hz."</p>
<p>Also there are utility classes for parsing and formatting times.</p>
