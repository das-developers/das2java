<p>Mostly contains DasCanvasComponents, which are components that live within
the DasCanvas, and Renderers which draw on DasPlots.  DasCanvas, a subclass of
JComponent, is the container for drawing graphics in das2.  DasCanvasComponents
are added to the DasCanvas to set up the graphic.  DasCanvasComponents include
objects like DasAxis, DasColorBar, and DasPlot, but are simply objects that
occupy a region of the canvas specified with a DasRow (vertical position) and 
DasColumn (horizontal position).  Note too the CanvasComponents can be
heirarchitical, for example a DasPlot contains two DasAxes.  Each CanvasComponent
has a DasMouseInputAdapter that handles mouse and keyboard events for the
component.

<p>To add new 2-D plotting capabilities, Renderers are introduced to paint
the space defined by an x and y axis.  Examples of Renderers are SymbolLineRenderer 
(line plots) and SpectrogramRenderer (spectrograms).
