  1. mouse events / drag renderers / mouse modules
    1. difficult to reuse existing objects because a lack of composition.
    2. too much typeness in drag renderers, should let composing code enforce typeness.
    3. poor definition of the role of each class.
    4. need definition of how key strokes can be used, which are used by the DMIA which
         can the mousemodule use.
