    <p>Provides BeanInfos that wrap das2 objects to control the properties
that are exposed.  When the PropertyEditor is used to edit an object, it 
uses java bean conventions for identifying its properties.  Properties of 
objects that do not have a corresponding BeanInfo are discovered using the 
java beans convention of looking for methods
of the form getX() and setX() where X is the property name.  </p>
<p>The BeanInfos also provide a mechanism where the writable property set can be 
reduced depending on the role of the person using the application.  For example,
application developers would have the ability to freely adjust all parameters,
such as layout, datasets and rendering methods, while end users would only be
able to control the timeaxis.  This mechanism has never been used, but it's worth
mentioning since the implementing code is in there.

Also a utility class, BeansUtil, provides methods for discovering object properties.
